Matrix
======

Command line program for simple matrix operations.

Simplifies matrix calculations. 

Main code in `Matrix.java`.

Please run `javac Matrix.java` to compile followed by `java Matrix` to run the executable .class

Currently the code supports accepting 2 matrices, and outputting basic matrix math on each. Feel free to change the main function to do other things.
